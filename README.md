## Overview

Goblinmine's Minecart Tweaks is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that enhances minecart functionality, providing new features and improvements to make minecart usage more enjoyable and efficient. Whether you're an experienced player or new to the game, this mod aims to improve your minecart experience.

## Features

- **Copper Rails**: Introducing copper rails, a cost-effective alternative to powered rails. Crafted with copper, these rails are not only cheaper but also slightly faster than vanilla powered rails, providing a balanced upgrade for your rail system.
- **Improved Powered Rails**: Experience a significant boost in speed with enhanced powered rails. Travel faster and more efficiently across your worlds, reducing travel time and increasing productivity.

### Currently planned features
- **Minecart Chaining**: Soon, you will be able to chain multiple minecarts together, creating train-like systems for more extensive and organized transportation.
- **Enhanced Furnace Minecart**: The furnace minecart will receive an inventory slot capable of holding a whole stack of burnable items, increasing its operational time and reducing the need for constant refueling.
- **Chunk Loading**: Future updates will enable the furnace minecart to load chunks autonomously, allowing it to travel long distances without requiring a player to keep the chunks loaded.
- **Automated Fuel Management**: The furnace minecart will be able to draw fuel from a connected chest minecart, streamlining the refueling process and ensuring continuous operation without manual intervention.
